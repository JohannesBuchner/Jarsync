|                        JARSYNC - RSYNC IN JAVA                       |
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the source distribution of Jarsync, a library written in Java
that implements the rsync algorithm---a method for syncing remote files
by transmitting only the differences between the two files.

THIS IS ALPHA SOFTWARE. NOT EVERYTHING NEEDED IS YET IMPLEMENTED, AND
THAT WHICH IS IMPLEMENTED PROBABLY IS STILL INCREDIBLY BUGGY. THIS
DISTRIBUTION IS INTENDED FOR DEVELOPERS WHO WANT TO CONTRIBUTE, NOT FOR
DEVELOPERS SEEKING TO USE THE RSYNC ALGORITHM IN ANOTHER PROJECT, AND
CERTAINLY NOT FOR END USERS.

1. About this library.

The Rsync algorithm is a method for syncing two files on two different
computers connected via a low-bandwidth high-latency bidirectional
communications link. Instead of simply copying the new file onto the
old, it computes and sends checksums of the old file---which are,
altogether, possibly much smaller than the file itself---and the other
machine then uses to compute the differences between the old file and
the new. This machine then sends these differences back---again with
the hope that the differences are far smaller than the new file---and
the new file is recreated from these differences.

This library implements the rsync algorithm in Java, and provides a
simple API for using the algorithm.

For a more complete description of the rsync algorithm, see the paper
"The rsync algorithm", technical report TR-CS-96-05, by Andrew Tridgell
and Paul Mackerras, available from the URL

2. Compilation.

To configure and build the library, the `rdiff' example program, and the
test programs, simply say

	./configure
	make

If this is a CVS checkout, first execute `autoconf' to make the
configure script.

There is also a Jakarta Ant build.xml file, which by executing

	ant
	ant test

will build the same files as `make'.

There is no `install' target yet; to use the test programs and the rdiff
workalike program the Jar files `jarsync.jar' and `getopt.jar' need to
be in your CLASSPATH.

=======================================================================

3. The API.

The gist of the API (at this moment) is to provide the three most basic
functions in the rsync algorithm -- checksum generation, delta
generation, and file patching. A higher-level interface may be added
later.

This is only an overview; see the API JavaDocs for more information.

  3.a. Checksum Generation.

  Checksum generation is handled with the `Generator' class, and comes
  in two basic flavors: generating over byte arrays and generating over
  files. All generation methods are called `generateSums', which will
  all return a java.util.Collection of ChecksumPair objects.

  The constructor can take a `Configuration' argument, which stores
  things such as the message digest algorithm, the block size, etc.


  3.b. Delta Generation

  Deltas are generated with the `Matcher' class, whose methods take
  either a java.util.Collection of checksums or a TwoKeyMap generated
  from the `buildHashtable' method, and either a byte array, a
  java.io.File, or a java.io.InputStream. All methods are called
  `hashSearch' and all return a java.util.Collection of `Delta' objects,
  which are either of type `Offsets' or `DataBlock'.

  The Matcher class can take a `Configuration', similar to Generator.


  3.c. File Patching

  Files are patched with the `Rebuilder' class, whose methods
  `rebuildFile'  will either take a basis file and a java.util.Collection
  of Deltas and return a new, temporary file containing the patched
  file; or take two files and a java.util.Collection, patching into one
  of them. The `rebuildFileInPlace' will patch the file in-place, not
  creating any temporary files.

  Since these methods are stateless, they are all static and do not
  depend upon a `Configuration'.

  There are no equivalent InputStream/byte[] methods, as these methods
  require random access.

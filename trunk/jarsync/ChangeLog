ChangeLog for JARSYNC.

$Id$

2002-08-14 -- 0.0.7

  - Not dead!

  - Administrata changes: all the classes are now in the
    org.metastatic.rsync package; MD4 is just a lone class and is not
    a JCE implementation; seperation of generation and matching methods
    into thier own respective classes; renamed 'Update' to 'Delta' --
    sounds better.

  - Some methods are slightly more comprehensible.

  - RollingChecksum appears to work and appears compatible with rsync's
    weak sum.

  - Interest in a program/library such as this appears to be on the
    rise; time to get going with developing this.

  - Moved to GPL.

2002-04-24 -- 0.0.6

  - Simple speed improvements to MD4 (inlining instead of calling the
    three functions FF, GG, and HH).

  - The rolling checksum made probably faster, better. I was using two
    long integers to store the two 16-bit parts of the checksum, not
    realizing that since Java's integral arithmetic is based on two's
    complement representations, that addition and subtraction act as
    though the numbers are unsigned. Thus two short integers instead
    (each half of the checksum is 16 bits) of long integers and doing
    all arithmetic explicitly modulo 2^32.

  - Removed logging statements from parts of Rsync.generateUpdates, to
    see how fast it runs for real. I could get about 43kb/sec on a
    Pentium 450 running Linux. This is not speedy, but hopefully given a
    modern machine it is good enough.

2002-04-08 -- 0.0.5

  - Core algorithm methods in place, except for memory-mapped File
    versions (if they are needed; it might be better to limit ourselves
    to 1.2 in the final release (using 1.4 is ok for development, within
    reason -- ie logging)). Tests over these methods appear to succeed.

  - TwoKeyMap now a full, if strange, Collection.

  - Checksums look almost compatible with the C implementation.

  - Class org.metastatic.util.Debug is obsoleted. Using
    java.util.logging classes for debug output now.
